This is just a text file. We can put whatever we want here.

You can save with CTRL + S, CTRL + Shift + S saves all

New documents that havent been sent to GitHub (or the local repo) have a "+" sign on the Solution Expolorer

To send the changes to GitHub:
1. Stage the changes we like (git add)

2. Commit those changes to the local repo (git mommit -m) This must include a commit message (small description of your changes)

3. Push those changes to the Remote Repo (git push orgin/main)

In VS 2022, we can do all of these steps at once

We created a new branch. this change was made on that branch, but will not exist on out "main" until we merge it on git hub

Typically, we will not make changes to the main branch
